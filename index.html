                    I became interested in programming by learning how to develop games. My first few games were created using Games Tutorials from https://developer.mozilla.org, such as the “Bounce off the walls” and “Paddle ball” games. These games were all built using pure JavaScript. Later on, I started building desktop games using Java/LibGDX and C#/Unity which are now published on my itch.io page. I have been passionate about Web Development and enjoy solving challenges across the entire stack. I’m also interested in learning about cloud computing and have been dabbling with AWS.
