                    I am a Computer Science student at Rutgers University with a strong passion for technology and problem-solving. My journey in programming began when I was a young teenager, captivated by computer games. I started learning game development through tutorials on the Mozilla Developer Network website, where I created games like "Bounce off the Walls" and "Paddle Ball" using JavaScript. As I progressed, I ventured into building desktop games using Java/LibGDX and C#/Unity, some of which I have published on my itch.io page.
During my time in high school, I had the opportunity to take various captivating Computer Science courses. After the introductory class in Java, I delved into courses like AP Computer Science A, Mobile App Development, Data Structures, Virtual and Augmented Reality, Artificial Intelligence, and Web Development. This diverse range of topics provided me with a comprehensive understanding of Computer Science. Applying the skills I acquired, I embarked on a Senior year Independent Study project, where I developed exciting projects. Notably, I created a Computer Vision/AI project that detects the number of fingers held up and a lane detection project. I presented these projects at the Board of Education meeting for my school district, advocating for their inclusion in the curriculum for future students. Currently, I am focusing on Web Development projects, enjoying solving challenges across the entire stack. Additionally, I am eager to explore cloud computing and have begun exploring AWS.
